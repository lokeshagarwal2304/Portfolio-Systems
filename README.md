## ✨ What is a Developer Portfolio?

A developer portfolio is more than just a website. It’s a **digital identity** that showcases your skills, projects, achievements, and vision to the world. It speaks for you when you’re not in the room – in front of recruiters, collaborators, or communities.

---

## 🚀 Why is it Important?

- 📌 **First impression** for recruiters, collaborators, and open-source folks  
- 🧠 **Reflection of your learning journey** and growth  
- 🧑‍💻 **Proof of work** – live, visual, and interactive  
- 🔄 **Sharable profile** for LinkedIn, GitHub, resumes, and tech events  
- 🎨 **Creative outlet** to express your unique design and tech stack combo
